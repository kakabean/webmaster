A toolkit to record and orchestrate your actions and repeat it when you need.

It is build for the you if you are boring by some repeatable and dirty web actions, e.g. do a click or input or scroll each 10 minutes, you know that many web application try to use such ways to catch you on their site, and then this toolkit maybe help.

No matter you are a programer, it is simple as you review a web page, you just need to record your actions and computer will help to do it for you automaticlly.

Enjoy it and you can comments me if you are unhappy when using.

I will try to do improving.

This is a personal project created early in 2009, I noticed that there are many web applicatoins like twitter or bbs or other on line interactions, that need your always remember that next 10 minutes later, I need to do a click or some inputs in a special web page. The things catched us in mind, I have to open web and do a stupid click even if in the midnight just because that I want to be more stronger in the web game or more chance to get a wanted tickets.

Its boring dirty worked, but the sponsers designed the rules we have to follow.

The first version was deployed on autowebkit.com on 2012, and removed later, I will try to rebuild the env later.
